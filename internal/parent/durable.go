	// SMB2_CREATE_RESPONSE_LEASE_V2 (§2.2.14.2.11) and
	// SMB2_CREATE_RESPONSE_LEASE (§2.2.14.2.10). It never constructs a durable
	// handle response, and step 2.14 makes a DH2Q arriving alongside a DH2C an
	// error — so a DH2Q reply answers a request context the client could not
	// legally have sent. Apple's SMBClient reaches the same conclusion from the
	// wire (smb_smb_2.c: "The response to a DH2C seems to be ONLY a RqLs
	// reply"), and the mistake is not cosmetic there: the client clears
	// SMB2_DURABLE_HANDLE_RECONNECT only in its RqLs arm, while its DH2Q arm
	// clears SMB2_DURABLE_HANDLE_REQUEST, which a reconnect never set. Echoing
	// DH2Q therefore left the client believing the reconnect was still pending
	// after a reconnect we had in fact granted, and additionally tripped
	// SMB2_DURABLE_HANDLE_FAIL for the request/response version mismatch.
	//
	// DHnC — §3.3.5.9.7 is a different section with its own construction phase,

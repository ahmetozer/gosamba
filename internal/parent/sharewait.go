// Waiting out a transient sharing conflict.
//
// MS-SMB2 §3.3.5.9 says a CREATE that loses the sharing-access check is
// answered STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION, and gosamba does. What it has no way to
// do is make the conflicting handle go away: ksmbd clears the same conflict by
// breaking the holder's oplock (fs/smb/server/oplock.c, smb_grant_oplock), and
// gosamba grants no handle-caching lease, so a conflict it refuses is a
// conflict it never revisits.
//
// That matters because of how macOS deletes. smbfs opens the victim deny-all
// — the only NTCREATEX_SHARE_ACCESS_NONE open in the whole client
// (SMBClient kernel/smbfs/smbfs_smb_2.c, radar <17346821>) — so *any*
// concurrent open of that file refuses the delete. And the client never
// retries: kernel/netsmb/smb_subr.c maps STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION straight to
// EBUSY and hands it to userspace. With two machines on one share, a few
// milliseconds of overlap between one client's read and another's delete is
// enough to fail rm — which leaves .git/index.lock on disk and breaks the
// repository until someone removes it by hand.
//
// So the server absorbs the window. A refused CREATE parks until the
// conflicting reservation is released or the deadline passes, whichever comes
// first.

	// that never lets go. It is far inside any client's request timeout.

	// A CREATE parks at most once: the pre-open check for a truncating

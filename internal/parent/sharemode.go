// Share-mode (deny-mode) enforcement — MS-SMB2 §3.3.5.9.
//
// Every SMB2 CREATE carries a ShareAccess mask saying which *other* opens the
// client is willing to tolerate on the same file. It is the only mechanism SMB
// offers for whole-file mutual exclusion, and a large amount of software leans
// on it: SQLite's -journal/-wal side files, Office lock files, Xcode, Photos
// libraries. The server is the only place it can be enforced — macOS keeps no
// cross-client bookkeeping of its own. smbfs_get_rights_shareMode() turns
// O_SHLOCK into deny-write and O_EXLOCK into deny-all, puts that on the wire,
// and then relies entirely on the server answering STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION,
// which it maps to EBUSY. Decoding ShareAccess and discarding it means two
// machines can both take an exclusive open and neither is told.
//
// Scope: the table is process-global, for the same reason sharedLockManager is
// (see lockmanager.go). A per-connection table would let two clients hold
// mutually-exclusive opens on the same file and never see each other, which is
// exactly the bug.
//
// Keying: by file identity (device + inode), never by path. Hard links give one
// file two names, and the normalization-insensitive resolver
// (vfs.ResolveSecureNorm) lets the same file arrive under different byte
// sequences. Both must land on the same entry.

// SMB2 SHARE_ACCESS bits (MS-SMB2 §2.2.13). A zero mask denies everything.

// The DesiredAccess bits that make an open count as "reading", "writing" or
// "deleting" for the sharing check. These follow Windows' IoCheckShareAccess:
// only data access and DELETE participate — FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES,
// READ_CONTROL, SYNCHRONIZE and the EA bits do not, so a pure stat-style open
// never trips a deny mode.
//
// MAXIMUM_ALLOWED (0x02000000) is deliberately absent. Windows resolves it to
// the access it actually granted; we grant the file's full POSIX-derived mask,
// so resolving it the same way would turn every MAXIMUM_ALLOWED open into
// read+write+delete and refuse ordinary deny-write opens alongside it. Treating
// it as requesting nothing is the permissive choice, and a false
// STATUS_SHARING_VIOLATION is far more visible than a missed one.

// and smbfs_get_rights_shareMode can hand them a deny-all ShareAccess, so
